## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, organized efficiency, trustworthy authority
**Design Personality**: Serious yet approachable, emphasizing precision without intimidation
**Visual Metaphors**: Aviation charts and logbooks - structured, methodical, professional
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean, organized interface that prioritizes information hierarchy over decorative elements

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous colors in the blue-gray spectrum with strategic accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep navy blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 220)) - representing aviation authority and trust
**Secondary Colors**: Light blue-grays for cards and backgrounds, maintaining professional tone
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - drawing attention to key actions and status indicators
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism essential in aviation training; amber provides clear visual hierarchy for important actions
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Primary text: Very dark blue-gray (oklch(0.2 0.1 220)) on light backgrounds
- Card text: Same dark blue-gray on white (oklch(1 0 0))
- Primary actions: White text on navy primary
- Status indicators: Color-coded with sufficient contrast (green for final, amber for draft)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single-family approach using Inter for consistency and excellent readability
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between form labels (medium weight), input text (regular), and status indicators (semibold)
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism while maintaining excellent legibility across devices
**Readability Focus**: Optimized for data-heavy forms with adequate line spacing and font sizing
**Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights) loaded from Google Fonts
**Legibility Check**: Inter tested and proven for excellent readability in professional applications

### Component Design Guidelines

#### Form Layout Strategy
**Progressive Disclosure**: Basic lesson information → Training objectives → Assessment details
**Logical Grouping**: Related fields grouped in cards with clear visual separation
**Responsive Adaptation**: Two-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile with sidebar information accessible

#### Status Communication
**Draft State**: Amber indicators, edit capabilities, save reminders
**Final State**: Green indicators, locked editing, completion confirmation
**Visual Hierarchy**: Status badges prominently displayed, consistent iconography throughout

#### Data Input Optimization
**Smart Defaults**: Auto-populate common fields, remember instructor preferences
**Validation Feedback**: Real-time validation with constructive error messaging
**Quick Actions**: One-click addition of common objectives, bulk operations for efficiency

### Accessibility & Usability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large)
**Keyboard Navigation**: Complete form accessibility via keyboard with logical tab order
**Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly interfaces suitable for tablet use in training environments
**Error Prevention**: Clear required field indicators, validation before critical actions
